# Lombokize-and-API-Documentation
Work on your group project to 'Lombokize' and Add API Documentation to each microservice.  Use a shared git team repository.  Each team member must work on their own microservice. Lombokize all your Entity Beans and Models. Add Swagger2 API Documentation to each microservice. Make sure that all functionality works and nothing has been broken. Commit and Push all your changes to the shared git repo. Also, start working on your Frondend part for the project. Share responsibilities among team members. Create a separate repository if necessary.  Important! Continue on the same git repository as in previous assignments. Keep all your previous commits. Submit your git repository links for the frontend and backend sides.
